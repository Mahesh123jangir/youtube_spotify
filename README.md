Overview of the project: YouTube and Spotify data Python's standard data analysis in a Jupyter notebook

In this research, we will examine data sets that include details about Spotify tracks and YouTube music videos.
Datasets from Kaggle were used to compile them, and they include details like title, artist, genre, views, likes,
and popularity. To do the analysis, Jupyter Notebook and Python will be used.

Identifying the most popular music videos on YouTube is one of the goals.
2. To examine the distribution of YouTube music video views, favourites, and disapprovals.
3. To discover the most well-liked musical categories on Spotify and YouTube.
4. To examine the Spotify song popularity distribution.
5. To spot patterns and trends in the music business.

Methodology:
1. Cleaning the data: We will purge the data of unnecessary columns and deal with missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand the data and spot patterns and trends, we shall do EDA.
3. Data Visualisation: To show our findings, we'll make use of visualisations including bar graphs, line graphs,
   and scatter plots.
4. Statistical Analysis: To find correlations and trends in the data, statistical analysis will be used.

Tools Applied
1. Python: Python will be used to analyse and visualise data.
2. Jupyter Notebook: To write and run our code, we'll use Jupyter Notebook.
3. Pandas: Pandas will be used to clean and manipulate data.
4. Matplotlib: To visualise data, we'll use Matplotlib.
5. Seaborn: For sophisticated data visualisation, we'll use Seaborn.
    
At the conclusion of this research, we want to have gained new perspectives on the music business, seen patterns
and trends, and given advice to record labels. We anticipate that this project will assist music labels in enhancing
their business plans and the listening experience for music fans.

In order to identify trends and insights, this project will analyse datasets containing data from songs on Spotify
and music videos on YouTube. We will undertake data cleansing, exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, and 
statistical analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook to learn more about the data. The goal of this project is to
advance the music business and improve the listening experience for music fans.
